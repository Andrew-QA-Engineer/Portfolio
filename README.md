## About me

Profile
I am a graduate with a background in software testing. I have completed a course in Basic Software Testing and am eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting. I am a quick learner, detail-oriented, and passionate about ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems. I have a little professional experience in the field, but I am excited to grow and develop my QA engineering skills. Likewise, I am familiar with testing methodologies such as manual testing, functional testing, regression testing, etc.
I have an understanding of programming languages such as Python. Likewise, I am also able to work well in a team and have excellent communication skills.
I am looking for an entry-level position as a Trainee or Junior QA
